## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.4 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- [**Generate diagrams and flowcharts from text**]({{< relref "writing-markdown-latex.md#diagrams" >}}), in a similar manner as Markdown
  - See *Diagrams* section below
- New **Strawberry theme** (see below)
  - To try it out, set `color_theme = "strawberry"` in `config/_default/params.toml`
- The **Page Sharer** buttons can now be easily [**customized**]({{< relref "customization.md#page-sharer" >}})
  - Select which social networks to show and configure the order of the sharing buttons
- Flexibility to write image gallery captions using **Markdown and emojis**
- **Automatically highlight the active page section** in the table of contents displayed in the right sidebar (for pages using the *docs* layout)
- Add support for page bundles when using the *docs* layout
  - Enables placing course/documentation files within their own folder, e.g. `courses/example/intro.md` can be renamed to `courses/example/intro/index.md` if desired

### Diagrams

You can generate diagrams and flowcharts from text, in a similar manner as Markdown.

Just add `diagram: true` to a page's YAML front matter and insert your [Mermaid diagram syntax](https://mermaidjs.github.io) in the *Diagram* shortcode and that's it. For example,

```plaintext
{{</* diagram */>}}
graph LR;
    A[Hard edge] -->|Label| B(Round edge)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result one]
    C -->|Two| E[Result two]
{{</* /diagram */>}}
```

renders as

{{< diagram >}}
graph LR;
    A[Hard edge] -->|Label| B(Round edge)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result one]
    C -->|Two| E[Result two]
{{< /diagram >}}

### Strawberry theme

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.3:

- If you are using `head_custom.html` for custom `<head>` HTML, it must be renamed to `custom_head.html`
- If you are overriding any of Academic's layout files, you may need to re-apply your HTML modifications to the [updated layouts which inherit from a new base template](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/pull/1115)

## Docs

- **Automatically highlight the active page section** in the table of contents displayed in the right sidebar

## Misc

- for personal sites, link a superuser's profile box to the homepage rather than their profile page
- fix case where social sharing links are empty
- style: make tables responsive (fixes display issues with wide tables)
- convert archetypes from TOML to YAML
- fix Academic's RSS template not applied to sections or taxonomies
- fix font-family for code snippets no longer loaded from font theme 
- fix Gallery captions not loading when using Gallery in Widget Pages

## Languages

- Add Romanian
- Update German, French, Spanish, Portuguese
